# google-search
## A front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search

The actual search function forwards the search terms to Google and takes you directly to the Google results page. 

I used only HTML and CSS to implement it.

### Usage:
Open index.html in your browser and use it like your preferred search engine.

### Credits:
This project is implemented as part of CS50's Web Programming Course "CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript" (Projekt 0).
